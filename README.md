# smart-fridge
Introduction: This project is an IoT (internet of things) project. By this project we aimed to see inside our fridge from everywhere outside which we can access to internet. It is a problematic issue to know what materials we have at home to bring with us while going home, in this project we tried to find a solution for this problem. and by using some sensor and Netduino microcontroller we did a mobile app which user can see with their phone what do they have inside their fridge and which things are lucking(to bring while coming home). In addition to this user can choose a food and app will show that to make that food needed materials exist or not.
